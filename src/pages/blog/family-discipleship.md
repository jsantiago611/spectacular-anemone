## Introduction

\*\*\*\*\*\*Scripture for the most part is left out. Only main ideas are communicated here.\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

> "One of the grandest of those responsibilities is the call to all parents to be
> disciple-makers in their own homes. A disciple-maker is a follower of
> Christ helping others follow Christ.” 17

> “The hope of this book is to prepare you to equip your family for the work of ministry and help
> them grow up in every way into Christ, following a plan that is well
> thought-out and sustainable. 18

### A few warnings:

1.       “This is no ‘silver bullet’ for building a perfect family. Seesaws between
disappointing and delighting. From “used a bad word”…to “ended in argument”…to ruined
family tradition”…” every mom and dad…have some residue of shame to battle and
great need for grace regarding what they wish they would have done.”

2.      You will feel inadequate. Concerning your knowledge of God. Or your ability
to teach. Be encouraged, this is God’s work. We cannot save our children. We
are merely invited to be part of the journey.

3.      Not all children will know God. Remember: “there is no ‘hopeless case’ or a ‘lost
cause’. When the God of the Bible is involved.” 20 “Despite bumps along the
way, many of us will see faith sparked in the lives of our children through
intentional discipleship.”

### How to use this book:

*   Read actively, making notes, answering questions, and filling in the charts.

If married, read with spouse “to help you get in sync”. If single or have an
unbelieving spouse, “use as a motivator to ask some of your trusted church community
to go through the framework of time, moments, and milestones…”

### What we are not saying about leading your family: 24

\*1.       \*We are not asking you to make your kids the
most important thing in your life.
“we want to be experts at fighting the temptation to put our family first in a
way that usurps following our God.”24

2.      We are not putting responsibility for your
child’s salvation on you. “Making
disciples is about stacking and gathering the kindlings of truths, but only God
can spark the fire.”

3.      We are not shaming you. “If you defeated and sinking in shame or
guilt, stop reading, take a deep breath, and remind yourself that Christ came
that you might be free from sin and condemnation.”

4.      We are not unduly comparing you to other
families. “God’s not looking
at your and wising your kids were born in a different family.”

5.      We are not asking you to fake it. Your kids see you at your worst, which is why
we should own up and apologize to them and God. But that’s not an excuse to
stop pushing forward to get better.

6.    We are not saying you are alone in this.

7.       We are not saying every parent is qualified to
disciple their kids. When
parents are unable to be with their children, the church should rise up to
help.

8.      We are definitely not minimizing how important
this is.

 

### The Family that disciples

“This is your purpose
in your home: making eternal deposits in your children.” 29

“Your child is not
only your progeny; he or she is your protégé.”

What is family
discipleship?

“Put simply, it is
leading your home by doing whatever you can whenever you can to help your
family become friends and followers of Jesus.” 30

“Think less of them
as students in your home university and more as apprecentices invited to study
and exercise the way of God they see in and hear about from you.”

“..is the charge
to  realign your priorities, to acknowledge
that the spiritual feeding and the spirituatl covering of your children needs
to be as vital to your and your family as your children’s physical feeding and
physical covering.”34

The job is yours, not
the church’s.

Family Discipleship
is not…

·        
Family Discipleship
is not freeform spiritual exploration.

·        
Family
Discipleship is not using the word of God in order to get your way. “it’s easy
to create a home where it seems God loves us when we are good and is angre when
we are bad…love the kids you have, not the kids you wish you had.”

·        
Family Discipleship
is not a popular way to raise popular kids. “Raising kids that are ready to be
hated means raising kids who unashamedly love God even in the face of loathing
and alienation.”

·        
Family Discipleship
is not a strategy to become an admired person. Don’t feel the need to impress
your kids, but rather “impress upon them their desperate need for a heavenly
father.” This one got me.

·        
Family Discipleship
is not always the most appealing path.

What’s involved in
Family Discipleship? …

·        
Family
Discipleship is mostly ordinary., tied in with the natural rhymthms of the family
that already exist.

·        
Family
Discipleship involves taking the lead.

·        
Family
Discipleship means creating a family discipleship culture. “Culture is built
around values, beliefs, and behaviors. Every family has them…Designing a family
culture takes having a head of household that purposely set the tone fo the
spiritual environment. It is a home that makes family discipleship important
and normal.” 41

o  
Idea:
Create a list of values or a family mission statement. Use notion. Example: “The
Griffin family will strive to know God, to make him known, and to honor him in
all that we do.”…”We value discipline, obedience, repentance, grace, and fun.”

The Foundation

God has created 2
types of families to aid in the discipling of our children:

·        
The
immediate family: “God calls parents to make their home the primary environment
for the discipleship of children.” 50

·        
The
Family of God: “God calls the local church to equip the saints for the work of
ministry, including in their homes, and to share the load of spiritual
leadership for the next generation.”

What is the Parent’s
role in Family Discipleship?

Although our culture
has normalized the “Outsourcing” of our the education and training of our children
to “professionals…teachers, counselors, tutors, coaches, and churches.”, we are
given the primary “responsibility of religious instruction…as outlined in
scripture.”

This should be our priority,
not outsourced to a church.  1Tim 3:4-5.

This is hard, because..

·        
of sin,
which brings “some version of harmful actions, neglect, selfish passivity, and
conflict into every family.”

·        
Also, we
can sometimes react poorly to the recognition of sin.

·        
“one the main
disfunctions of family is withholding love, affection, or approval because a
child has not met a parental expectation.” Love them better than they deserve.
That’s a reflection of God’s love.

What is the Church’s
role in Family Discipleship?

The Greek family is referred
to as “household”, which referred to not just mom and dad and kids, but several
generations living in the house, like aunts, etc. The idea is that others help
by coming along parents with “love, support, accountability, and prayer.”

 8 things the Bible says about family

1.       God teaches us about our relationship to him
through family. We are his adopted
children and he is our father. 1 John 3:1

2.      God teaches the inherent value of Children. Ps
127:3-5

3.      God created, loves, and wants faithful
marriages. Prov 18:22, Hebrews 13:4

4.      God commands that children are to be cared for
and trained.

5.      God commands that parents are to be honored
and obeyed.

6.      God tells and shows us what to teach children.
God’s word. The Gospel. Trusting God. Proverbs. Jesus.

7.       God does not take family responsibilities
lightly.matt 18:6

8.      God gives families the gift of forgiveness.

Modeling

Family
Discipleship modeling defined:
Serving as a Godly example for your family, living out your genuine walk with
God, and demonstrating true repentance where and when  you fall short.

·        
Kids
learn from how we live.

“Your
life well lived, walking as Jesus walked, can be more influential that a
hundred lectures about your beliefs.”

This chapter helps us
plan out our own spiritual development as an individual. Our kids are watching,
even when we don’t want them to. What will they learn from us? What is most important
to us?

“God has asked you
to be diligent in the way that you care for your own soul, and he wants you to
invite your children to follow your example as you follow Christ.”

Examples:

·        
Chandler
House: Get up early to study and pray. Model hospitality. Model repentance.

·        
Griffin
House: Love neighbors.

*How do we do this?*

In order to set an
example worth following you should be both reliable and relatable for your children
– a person of repentant integrity in relational proximity to your family.

2 key components of
Modeling:

1.       We must be Reliable: You must have integrity. You’re
honest about your strengths and shortcomings. Be a role model of what you want
to see. (i.e. if you want kids to speak kindly, “seek to be the epitome of kindness.
If you would like to see your kids grow in patience, then make every effort to
be ‘quick to speak, low to anger.’(James 1:19)).Repent quickly and thoroughly.

2.    We must be Relatable: “Be relatable enough to let those close to you
see who you really are. Be vulnerable enough to let someone see your life—how you
make choices, how you handle failure, and how you turn to God’s word to
determine who you are and what you’re called to.” But its not just “Being Christian
near your children.” It’s active participation. Inviting them to come alongside
you and point out what you do/believe and why.

Some of us have to do
Remodeling, if we never had a Godly example growing up. We do that by:

1.       Ask for a forgiving heart towards your parents
mistakes.

2.      Understand that you’re not going to automatically
walk in their footsteps. You won’t repeat their mistakes as you forge a new
path.

3.      Invite someone to be your mentor, filling in
that space.

4 areas that we can model
Christian living to our children (in this order, which is the right order of
your life loves):

1.       Love your God. Don’t fake it. Be genuine as you practice the
habits and disciplines of Christianity like:

a.      Reflect on your obedience and responses to
God.

b.      Seek to understand what the Bible says.

c.      Pray “with, for, and in front of your kids.”

d.      Invite accountability to your life.

2.      Love yourself. Don’t’ be narcissistic, but don’t beat
yourself up either. If you put yourself down around you kids, they’ll imitate
that, which will destroy any self-esteem and confidence in what God says about
them. If you are God’s children, why belittle yourself? Why put your identity
in your kids?

3.      Love your neighbor. Children won’t naturally
do this, so it must be modeled.

4.      Love your spouse. One day the kids will grow
up, and must reference your marriage as what to look for in their spouse. The
way you love spouse must be different that you love them. Parenthood progresses
towards a “Launch date”, whereas marriage is forever.

Time

Family
Discipleship Time is: “Creating intentional time built into the rhythm of the
family’s life for the purpose of thinking about, talking about, and living out the
gospel.”

“Regularly
gathering your family around the practice and study of the word of God should
be one of your highest calendar priorities.”

·        
Give it
everything you’ve got.

·        
Structure
usually has bible reading, prayer, worship and conversation, but format and
length can flex and change depending on how old the kids are and what’s your schedule.

·        
Doesn’t
have to be perfect.

·        
Kids are
capable of memorizing much.

·        
Give
opportunities to practice this by serving others.

Helpful to me was
Griffin’s and how they built this into their bedtime routine. They read a bible
story, talk about it, pray together, sing a song, hug individually, recite a “life
verse” to each childn. Ideas included 1 cor 16:13-14, 1 Kings 2:2-3,Mic6:8.

“Being
consistent and purposeful in how you initiate those times will take some
initial planning but the habit of gathering will gain momentum and
effectiveness the more ordinary and familiar it becomes.”

The
easiest way to become consistent is to build it into an existing routine, like
a bedtime, meal time, outing, commute, after/before church. Make it weekly or
daily but like Deut 6 says….just don’t quit.

To
become purposeful means that you design the time. It wont just happen. Also,
you’ve got to invest time and energy into it. We wouldn’t be unprepared for
work, so we shouldn’t take this lightly either.

“Take
stock of what takes up your time and energy, and make sure that family
discipleship time is getting your foremost attention.”

When
teaching, ask how you can better help your kids understand a concept/idea. Don’t
just look for head nods. Helpful questions are:

·        
What did
I say about:

·        
How many
\__\_ were metioned?

·        
What is
\__\_?

·        
What do
you think about \__\_?

·        
Tell me
about \__\_

·        
Share an
example of \__\_ from your own experience

·        
Explain
why \__\_.

·        
OLDER
KIDS:

·        
How will
this change the way you

·        
How does
\__ apply to you?

·        
How can
you demonstrate or practice

·        
What’s
the difference between

·        
Restate

·        
What
makes \__ better than \__\_

·        
What does
it look like in our family?

Keep it simple and fun,
or your kids won’t look forward to it.

Daily Ideas: build
around family meals, pray together, bedtime routine, during family commutes.

Weekly ideas: movie
night with useful theme, game night to encourage fruit of Spirit, restaurant night
and talk about faith. Worship service. Family Study/Devotions/worship. Family
Traditions.

Monthly: Serve in
community, one-on-one time, Guys/girls night. Block party.

Moments

“Family Discipleship
moments are capturing and leveraging opportunities in the course or everyday
life for the purpose of gospel-centered conversations.

·        
These
moments are all around us, since God is always at work. We should be astute,
with a “high degree of readiness, vigilance, and a willingness to pause and
take note of evidence of God and applications of the gospel nearby.”

·        
Reminds
me of Ben and the birds.

·        
“A single
remark can change the trajectory of a person’s life.” Pray for opps to plant
seeds.

·        
Here’s
how: STOP what your doing. LOOK at them in the eye. LISTEN to what you perceive
they are feeling, and TALK with encouraging works. STOP LOOK LISTEN SPEAK.
Simple.

·        
I like
how the Griffins use this to calm their chilren’s bedtime fears by reminding
the kids of God’s never sleeping and caring presence.

“As a parent,
seeking to disciple as Jesus discipled means being attentive and alert, looking
for opportunities to train your children by applying biblical truth to your
present circumstances.

We should use these
moments to teach about God’s character, or about Godly character.

“Memorizing God’s
word can make you a more effective disciple-maker and help you leverage family discipleship
moments for the sake of gospel conversations.

We should craft
discipleship language that our children can understand and use.

Milestones

“Conclusion: Family
discipleship milestones are marking and making occasions to celebrate and
commemorate significant spiritual milestones of God’s work in the life of the
family and individual child.” Types of milestones;

·        
Making: Creating
significant milestones to commemorate, celebrate, or commend spiritual growth.
Pray, share, sing, feast, reward, etc. Attach God’s faithfulness to t=their “Firsts”.
Use holidays.

·        
Marking: Unpredictable.
Celebrate those milestones that you didn’t anticipate, such as salvation,
baptism, even dark times like death can be used as reminders that Christ has
conquered death.

“Milestones can be momentous
events, so they may require a greater level of creativity and effort, but that
is not required.”

Examples: Heirlooms
and momentos. Rituals and traditions. Events and experiences. Crafts and
projects. Feasts and fasts. Monuments and memorials. Responsibility and
authority. Symbols and crests. Journeys and destinations.

 

 “Spiritual Milestones can simply be new ways
to take advantage of existing celebrations in your family’s life. However your
plan works out, celebrating noteworthy moments in a way that is more memorable
can correspondingly have a greater impact on your family’s life. Milestones are
a tremendous opportunity to enjoy and share in commemorating all that the Lord
has done.”
