### Technical Notes

The backend runs on the [JAMStack ](https://jamstack.wtf/)using [GatsbyJS ](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/)as the Static Site Generator. The content is hosted on Github, and the site is built on Netlify. Everything is easily managed via [StackBit ](https://www.stackbit.com/about)(Stackbit is a site builder that connects all these technologies. Create your own [here](https://app.stackbit.com/create?theme=agency\&utm_source=deployed-footer)).

The site doesn't use Google Analytics (or any other analytics software) because your privacy matters. Your identity and how many times you visit the site are not tracked at all.
